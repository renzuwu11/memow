📝 #memow

#memow is a cloud-based note-taking web application developed as part of our Database Administration course at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. The main objective was to implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a functional web interface — and we delivered exactly that.

As the Project Manager and Full-Stack Developer, I led the creation of this one-month project that allows users to securely create and manage their notes in a simple, intuitive interface — like your favorite notepad, but smarter and online.

This project was successfully completed and met all the required outcomes for the course.
